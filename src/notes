First example:

What is stashing?
saving our codes to a temporary area for later use is called stashing!!!

Why do we need stashing?

1. you are working on a bew test feature that you want yet to be in the commits because you are not sure wether it will
 be working or not!!!

2. in order to update your local repo in sync with the remote repo, without discarding the changes in working
 directory!!!
